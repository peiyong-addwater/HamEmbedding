# Hamiltonian Embedding of Images for Data Reuploading Classifiers

This repo contains the code and experiment results for the paper *Hamiltonian Embedding of Images for Data  Reuploading Classifiers*. 
In the paper, we proposed several principles, or rules-of-thumb, for designing quantum machine learning models that operates on classical data. These experiments emperically verify our proposed
principles with a data re-uploading classifier combined with Hamiltonian embedding of image data.
